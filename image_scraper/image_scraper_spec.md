# Design An Image Index


## What do i mean by image index?
-  I want you to create a system to store all easily accessible new images posted on the web each day and build an application that lets a user search through all of those images.


### FUN FACT: WE CREATED 2.5 QUINTILLION data bytes every day in 2020

### Fun fact: our system should display 100 related images to a given search term and support infinite scroll functionality, so searching will be a priority of this system.

### Fun fact in our image service we have a lot of daily active users. 6 Sextillion data bytes are queried everyday so this system is more read heavy than write heavy.
